# Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

### Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.


## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        lst = [0] * 26

        for c in s:
            i = ord(c) - ord('a')
            lst[i] += 1

        for c in t:
            i = ord(c) - ord('a')
            if lst[i] == 0:
                return c
            lst[i] -= 1
```
