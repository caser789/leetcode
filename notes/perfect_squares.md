# Perfect Squares


Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

## Solution

```
class Solution(object):
    def numSquares(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
```
