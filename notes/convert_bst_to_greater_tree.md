# Convert BST to Greater Tree

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

Example:

Input: The root of a Binary Search Tree like this:

```
              5
            /   \
           2     13
```

Output: The root of a Greater Tree like this:

```
             18
            /   \
          20     13
```
