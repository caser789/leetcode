# Largest Perimeter Triangle

Given an array A of positive lengths, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with non-zero area, formed from 3 of these lengths.

If it is impossible to form any triangle of non-zero area, return 0.



### Example 1:

Input: [2,1,2]
Output: 5

### Example 2:

Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 0

### Example 3:

Input: [3,2,3,4]
Output: 10

### Example 4:

Input: [3,6,2,3]
Output: 8


## Note:

3 <= A.length <= 10000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6
