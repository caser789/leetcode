# Number of Segments in a String

Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

### Example:

Input: "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5

## Solution

```
class Solution(object):
    def countSegments(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """

```
