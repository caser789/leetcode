# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

## Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        def doit(node):
            if node:
                vals.append(str(node.val))
                doit(node.left)
                doit(node.right)
            else:
                vals.append('#')
                
        vals = []
        doit(root)
        return ' '.join(vals)
        

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        vals = iter(data.split())
        
        def doit():
            val = next(vals)
            if val == '#':
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(val))
            node.left = doit()
            node.right = doit()
            return node
        return doit()
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root))
```
