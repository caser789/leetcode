# Word Pattern

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

### Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

### Example 2:

Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

### Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

### Example 4:

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false

## Notes:

You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.
