# Delete Node in a BST

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7

## Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, root, key):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type key: int
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if root is None:
            return
        
        def find_min(node):
            while node.left:
                node = node.left
            return node
        
        if key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        elif key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        else:
            if root.left is None:
                return root.right
            if root.right is None:
                return root.left
            n = find_min(root.right)
            root.val = n.val
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, n.val)
            
        return root
```
