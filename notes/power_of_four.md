# Power of Four

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example 1:

Input: 16
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: false
Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPowerOfFour(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
```
