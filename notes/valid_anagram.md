# Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

### Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

### Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

## Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

## Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
