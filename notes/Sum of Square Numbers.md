# Sum of Square Numbers

Given a non-negative integer c, your task is to decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: True
Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5
 

Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: False

## Solution

```
class Solution(object):
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c):
        """
        :type c: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
```
