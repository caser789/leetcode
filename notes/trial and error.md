# trial and error

## steps

1. construct a candidate solution
2. verify if it meets our requirements
3. if it does, accept it. else discard it and repeat step 1

## condition

1. efficient verify algorithm in step 2
2. the search space formed by all candidates solutions is small
3. efficient way to traverse the search space
